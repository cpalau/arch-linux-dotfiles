## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process

### Phase 1: Pre-installation (From Arch Linux Live USB)

1. **Boot Arch Linux Live USB**

2. **Download dotfiles** (choose one option):

   **Option A: With Active Ethernet Connection**
   ```bash
   # Clone directly from GitHub repository
   git clone https://github.com/cpalau/arch-linux-dotfiles.git /root/arch-linux
   cd /root/arch-linux
   # Make setup script executable
   chmod +x setup
   ```

   **Option B: From USB Drive**
   ```bash
   # Mount your USB drive (replace sdX1 with your USB device)
   mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt
   # Copy the entire dotfiles directory
   cp -r /mnt/arch-linux /root/
   cd /root/arch-linux
   # Make setup script executable
   chmod +x setup
   ```
3. **Configure WiFi credentials** (skip if using ethernet):
   ```bash
   # Edit the existing configuration file
   echo "WIFI_SSID=your_network_name" > config/setup_passwords.env
   echo "WIFI_PASSWORD=your_password" >> config/setup_passwords.env
   ```
4. **Run my pre-installation setup** (handles WiFi connection and system preparation):
   ```bash
   ./setup pre-install
   ```

This will:
- **Automatically detect network connections** (ethernet takes priority over WiFi)
- Configure Spanish keyboard layout  
- Connect to WiFi network (only if ethernet is not available)
- Update package sources
- Install git and wget
- **Execute archinstall automatically** using provided configuration files
- **Complete system installation** with disk partitioning, user creation, and base setup

### Phase 2: Post-installation (From Installed System)

After rebooting into the new Arch Linux system:

```bash
./setup post-install
```

This will:
- Configure my system settings
- Install my additional packages
- Deploy my dotfiles
- Setup my system services

### Full Setup (Complete Process)

For my complete automated setup:

```bash
./setup full
```

## üåê Network Connection Management

The setup script includes intelligent network detection that prioritizes ethernet connections:

### Automatic Network Detection
- **Ethernet Priority**: The script automatically detects active ethernet connections and verifies connectivity to archlinux.org
- **WiFi Fallback**: WiFi setup is only performed when ethernet is unavailable or cannot reach archlinux.org
- **Arch Linux Connectivity**: All connections are verified against archlinux.org to ensure package downloads will work

### Connection Types Supported
- **Ethernet**: Automatic detection of `eth*` and `en*` interfaces with active IP addresses
- **WiFi**: Manual configuration through `setup_passwords.env` file (used as fallback)

### How It Works
1. **Detection Phase**: Script scans for active ethernet interfaces with IP addresses
2. **Connectivity Test**: Tests connection to archlinux.org to ensure package repositories are accessible
3. **Priority Logic**: If ethernet passes connectivity test, WiFi setup is completely skipped
4. **Fallback Mode**: If ethernet fails or is unavailable, proceed with WiFi configuration
5. **Final Verification**: All connections are tested against archlinux.org before proceeding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

### WiFi Configuration (`config/setup_passwords.env`)

**Note**: This file is only required if you don't have an active ethernet connection. The script will automatically detect ethernet connections and skip WiFi setup when ethernet is available.

```bash
WIFI_SSID=your_network_name
WIFI_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Archinstall Configuration

The system uses two separate files for archinstall automation:

#### System Configuration (`config/archinstall_config.json`)
Contains system-wide settings for the installation:
```json
{
    "bootloader": "Grub",
    "hostname": "pulgoso", 
    "kernels": ["linux-lts"],
    "locale_config": {
        "kb_layout": "es",
        "sys_lang": "es_ES.UTF-8"
    },
    "disk_config": {
        "config_type": "manual_partitioning",
        "device_modifications": [...]
    },
    "profile_config": {
        "profile": {"main": "Minimal"}
    }
}
```

#### User Credentials (`config/archinstall_credentials.json`)
Contains encrypted user passwords and configuration:
```json
{
    "root_enc_password": "$y$j9T$...",
    "users": [{
        "username": "cristian",
        "enc_password": "$y$j9T$...",
        "sudo": true,
        "groups": []
    }]
}
```

**Note**: Both files are included and ready to use. The credentials use encrypted passwords generated by archinstall.

## üîê Private Files Management

The `private/` directory is designed to store sensitive files that should NOT be committed to version control:

### Structure
```
private/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh/          # SSH keys and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gpg/          # PGP/GPG keys  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials/  # Other sensitive files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Documentation (this file IS committed)
```

### Usage
- Store SSH private/public keys in `private/ssh/`
- Store PGP/GPG keys in `private/gpg/`
- Store other sensitive files in `private/credentials/`
- The entire `private/` directory is ignored by git (except README.md)
- Use proper file permissions (600 for private keys)

### Security Notes
- Files in `private/` are automatically ignored by git
- Backup these files securely and separately from the repository
- Consider encrypting sensitive files before storing them

## üì¶ Package Management Structure

The package installation system is organized by package manager for maximum clarity:

### Official Repositories (`pacman/`)
- **base.txt**: Essential system packages (sudo, git, vim, etc.)
- **development.txt**: Development tools from official repos (gcc, python, nodejs, etc.)
- **desktop.txt**: Desktop environment packages (gnome, firefox, etc.)
- **optional.txt**: Additional software from official repositories

### Arch User Repository (`aur/`)
- **base.txt**: Essential packages from AUR (yay, base-devel extensions, etc.)
- **development.txt**: Development tools from AUR (visual-studio-code-bin, etc.)
- **desktop.txt**: Desktop applications from AUR (discord, spotify, etc.)
- **optional.txt**: Optional AUR packages (games, specialized tools, etc.)

This structure ensures:
- **Clear separation** between official and AUR packages
- **Efficient installation** (batch install per package manager)
- **Easy maintenance** and customization
- **No ambiguity** about which package manager to use

### Package List Format
Each package file uses a standardized format for easy parsing:
```bash
# Comments start with #
# Package entries start with - followed by package name
- package_name
- another_package
```

Example from `aur/development.txt`:
```bash
# Conventional Commits Tool
# Python tool for creating conventional commits
# https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
- python-commitizen
```

## üîß Available Commands

```bash
./setup pre-install    # Run my pre-installation setup
./setup post-install   # Run my post-installation setup
./setup full           # Run my complete setup process
./setup --help         # Show help information
./setup --version      # Show version information
```

- WiFi configuration (`config/setup_passwords.env`) is **only required** when no ethernet connection is available  
- The pre-install script **automatically runs archinstall** with the provided configurations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: The installation will format disks according to `archinstall_config.json`
- I run `./setup pre-install` from the Arch Linux live USB environment
- I run `./setup post-install` from the installed Arch Linux system
- My system uses modular scripts for easy maintenance and customization

## üîí Security

### SSH Configuration

I've included a hardened SSH server configuration for secure remote access:

#### Files Included:
- **`dotfiles/sshd_config`**: Secure SSH server configuration for Arch Linux ‚úÖ
- **`dotfiles/ssh_banner`**: Warning banner displayed before login ‚úÖ

#### Security Features Implemented:
- **No Root Login**: Root access via SSH completely disabled
- **SSH Key Authentication Only**: Password authentication disabled
- **Custom Port**: Uses port 2222 instead of default 22
- **Modern Cryptography**: Only secure algorithms allowed
- **Connection Limits**: Rate limiting and timeout protection
- **User Access Control**: Only specific users allowed
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit logging enabled
- **Forwarding Disabled**: X11 and TCP forwarding blocked
- **Legal Banner**: Warning message for unauthorized access

#### Installation Instructions:
```bash
# Copy SSH configuration files
sudo cp dotfiles/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo cp dotfiles/ssh_banner /etc/ssh/banner

# Set proper permissions
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/banner

# Test configuration before applying
sudo sshd -t

# Apply configuration
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# Generate SSH keys if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

#### Important Notes:
- Replace 'cristian' in `AllowUsers` with your actual username
- Change the port number (2222) to your preferred custom port
- Ensure you have SSH keys set up before disabling password authentication
- Test the configuration from another terminal before closing your current session

### General Security Practices

- My WiFi credentials are stored locally and never transmitted
- Temporary password files are automatically cleaned up
- All my scripts include error handling and validation
